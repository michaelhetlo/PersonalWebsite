Currently I am a Research and Development Quantitative Analyst for the New York Yankees. My career goals are to combine my two passions of data science and sports (specifically baseball) seamlessly to help teams win and players get better. As a data scientist I preform skills such as data cleaning and wrangling, machine learning modeling, data visualization, shiny applications, and Bayesian modeling. All of which are demonstrated in my projects below. There are more projects to come, so stay tuned! Feel free to reach out via LinkedIn if you have any questions!\n\nLink to Resume\nResume Link\nSocial Links\nLinkedInGitHub\nStolen Base Probability Model\nUsing Bayesian Models this app predicts the probability of a runner to sucessfully steal a base in the MLB.
